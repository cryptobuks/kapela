# The Kapela Project
> A Primer

Overview: Kapela is a blockchain-powered messaging and payment platform. Messages and payments can be sent as anonymously and securely as one would require, and with a decentralized structure, there is no single point of failure where stored data can be accessed without the permission of a user's private key signature. This results in a cross-platform method of transacting that we are all used to, but without the censorship we face on a daily basis.

## Main Idea: 

The main idea of The Kapela Project was to fork the DigitalNote project. The decline of DigitalNote can be found in the lack of developer support, as the community seems to still pursue activity and growth, but are not receiving the support needed to even operate the software efficiently. We have no plans on picking up a project from the ashes without receiving a large stake in such project, and with no central authority to dictate such stakes, we are left with the clear solution of forking the software and consuming the previous community base.

In order to expand Kapela as fast a possible, we decided it would be best to rebuild the C++ implementation using JavaScript. This would allow us to focus on a web application, and with a few tweaks we can get both desktop and mobile versions launched. Once the JavaScript implementation is live, we will scrap the old DigitalNote C++ code, and build new software in Go for miners and nodes. At this point, we would have a completely in-house operation with no main code coming from the old DigitalNote team. 

TL;DR: C++ to JavaScript. Web, Desktop, and Mobile applications. Source and tools in Go for miners and nodes.
