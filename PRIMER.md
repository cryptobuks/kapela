# The Kapela Project
> A Primer

Overview: Kapela is a blockchain-powered messaging and payment platform. Messages and payments can be sent as anonymously and securely as one would require, and with a decentralized structure, there is no single point of failure where stored data can be accessed without the permission of a user's private key signature. This results in a cross-platform method of transacting that we are all used to, but without the censorship we face on a daily basis.
